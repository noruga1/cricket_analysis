# BGT Test Analysis

This repository contains the BGT Test Analysis project, including both a Jupyter Notebook (`BGT_Test_Analysis_Final.ipynb`) and an exported HTML version (`BGT_Test_Analysis_Final.html`). The project involves in-depth data analysis and visualization for evaluating BGT performance metrics.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize BGT test data to extract insights and trends. The analysis is performed using Python with relevant data science libraries.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `BGT_Test_Analysis_Final.ipynb`
- The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- Includes code, visualizations, and detailed comments for replicability and understanding.

### 2. `BGT_Test_Analysis_Final.html`
- An HTML-exported version of the Jupyter Notebook for easier viewing without requiring a Jupyter environment.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Statistical analysis and key metrics extraction.
- Visualization of trends and patterns.
- Detailed comments and documentation to guide users through the analysis process.
